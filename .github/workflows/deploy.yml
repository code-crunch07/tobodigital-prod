# Auto-deploy to server when pushing to main
# Requires GitHub repo secrets: DEPLOY_HOST, DEPLOY_USER, SSH_PRIVATE_KEY, DEPLOY_PATH
# Server must be reachable from the internet on SSH port (GitHub runners are in the cloud).
# If you get "dial tcp: i/o timeout", the host is unreachable (firewall, private VPC, or wrong host).
